This is a Fabric mod that adds the clay urn to the game, a fragile container that is affected by gravity. [Also available at CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/urns).

Inspired by old-school RPGs where you had urns/vases/pots around the map which you could break to get their contents, along with Minecraft Dungeons' emerald pots.

### Behavior

- **Container**: holds up to **one item stack**. Right-click or use a hopper to store items;
- **Mysterious**: there is no GUI. To discover what's inside, use either a hopper or **brute force**!
- **Affected by gravity**: falls if there isn't a supporting block below (like sand);   
- **Mobile**: as long as it's falling, you may **move it around** with slime blocks, water elevators, etc.!
- **Fragile**: if the urn falls from a height of three blocks or more, it will **crack**. If it's already cracked, then it will **break** â€” unless it lands on slime or hay;
- **Weaponizable**: hurts entities on landing (like an anvil);
- **Craftable**: with bricks;
- **Decorative**.

### Installation

Make sure you downlaod the  [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api). Afterwards, just drop the mod jar into your mods folder.
